> As part of our Thinking Cap series, two of the most beautiful wingnuts we know permitted us a brief glimpse into their collaborative, poetic, finely tuned and deeply nuanced creative process. Emily Baker of Sword + Fern and sound artist Kerby Ferris — together they form Lavender Mirror — bend molecules to their will, help Uncle Larry make sense of it all, and love each other beyond measure.
> Watch and weep, and make stuff.
